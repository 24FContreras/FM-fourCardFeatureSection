### What I learned

This challenge gave me a bit of a hard time, but it was fun and I learned a lot on the proccess!

I'm still new to responsive layouts, but I feel I have a better grasp right now. I also used some stuff that I don't use often, like ::before pseudo-element for the top color bars on the cards.

```scss
.card::before {
  position: absolute;
  content: "";
  height: 0.23rem;
  width: 100%;
  top: 0;
}
```

<br>

### Continued development

While I'm still not 100% confortable with pseudo-elements, I will keep working with them on a daily basis. Not only because they make the html cleaner, but because of the incredible stuff you can do with them. I'll also keep working to improve my flexbox skills, as well as building responsive layouts.
